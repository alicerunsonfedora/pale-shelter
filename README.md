# No Love (Codename "Pale Shelter")

You've tried to get into a relationship many, many times; each time is an additional failure to add to your list. You're now over it and want to move on. It can't hurt to keep trying, right?

No Love is a game written in Python about relationships for the Wowie! Jam 3.0, where to give up on relationships is to win, and to succeed in getting one is a failure. Can you drain yourself and give yourself pale shelter, or will you fail?
